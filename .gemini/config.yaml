  # Guidelines for Writing a Code Review or Summary of Changes

  ## Common

  ### Target Reader

  Assume that your audience is the developer who modified the code and is already familiar with it. Write with clarity and precision, focusing on providing insights and improvements.

  ### No Fluff

  Eliminate unnecessary filler, padding, perfunctory content, box-ticking content, pro forma content, or content included merely as a formality. Focus solely on the technical content and interesting (or funny) insights related to the code. Remove introductions or extended formalities unless they add real value.

  ### Utilize Visuals Extensively

  Actively incorporate visual tools such as diagrams and tables alongside text explanations. These visuals help to articulate the code’s structure and flow intuitively.

  #### Visual Code Explanations

  - Add concise comment diagrams next to code blocks to explain complex sections.
  - Integrate various visualization tools like tables or alternative charts to enhance understanding.
  - Use Markdown tables to clearly represent types.
  - For core algorithms, provide step-by-step visualizations.
  - Depict the data transformation process using sequential diagrams.
  - Create memory/resource usage diagrams for resource-intensive sections.

  #### Visual Diagrams

  - **Actively use Mermaid diagrams**: Provide diagram code that can be directly included in markdown.
  - **Flowcharts**: Visualize code execution flow and major branching points.
  - **Sequence Diagrams**: Represent object interactions and method call order.
  - **Class Diagrams**: Express class structure, inheritance relationships, dependencies.
  - **State Diagrams**: Represent state transitions for code where state changes are important.
  - **ER Diagrams**: Express entity relationships if data models are included.
  - **Component Diagrams**: Express system components and dependencies.

  ##### Precautions for Mermaid Diagrams

  When creating Mermaid diagrams, note the following to prevent parsing errors:

  1. Special characters in node text (e.g., parentheses, periods, question marks) can cause errors.
  2. Enclose any node text containing special characters (e.g., (), #, :) in double quotes.
  3. For subgraph titles with spaces or special characters, use double quotes.
  4. Enclose complex text in sequence diagram messages within quotes.
  5. Keep node IDs simple (alphanumeric) and restrict special characters only to displayed text.
  6. When incorporating HTML tags like <br/>, ensure the entire text is quoted.
  7. For long text, prefer using line breaks over cramming everything into one node.

  ###### Error Example

  The following Mermaid code may cause errors because of unquoted special characters:

  ```mermaid
  flowchart TD
      A[Start] --> B{Check function() call?}
      B --> C[Next step(process)]
  ```

  In this script, the parts `B{Check function() call?}` and `C[Next step(process)]` cause parsing errors.

  ###### Solutions

  1. Remove or replace parentheses and special characters.
  2. Use alternative expressions where necessary.
  3. Wrap node text in quotes to mitigate parsing issues.

  ###### Recommendations

  - Use **simple expressions** for node text.
  - **Avoid** parentheses() and special characters if possible.
  - Find **alternative expressions** when complex expressions are needed.

  ### Enhancing Document Quality

  - Apply a clear markdown heading structure to improve **skimming**.
  - Use visual aids like diagrams and tables for step-by-step explanations of complex concepts.
  - Balance basic explanations for beginners with in-depth details for experts.
  - Present real usage scenarios and problem-solving examples.
  - Instead of copying code verbatim, provide commentary and additional insights that help clarify the code.
  - Feel free to propose creative visual representations or extra information that could further aid comprehension.

  ## Summary of Changes

  **Purpose:**
  Provide a concise summary of the modifications made to the codebase. This section should focus on what has been added, removed, or altered, along with the intended impact of these changes.

  ### Step 1: Code Analysis

  - Identify the main purpose and functionality of the code.
  - Determine the programming language and any frameworks or libraries used.
  - Analyze code complexity and interactions among key components.
  - Highlight core functions, classes, variables, and their relationships.
  - Trace the data flow and pinpoint potential confusion points.
  - Identify specific code sections that can benefit from visual illustrations.

  ### Step 2: Documentation Planning

  - Outline the overall structure and sections of the document.
  - List relevant code examples and the corresponding visual aids.
  - Specify which code elements need visualization and the appropriate diagram types.
  - Plan explanations for complex or easily misunderstood sections.
  - Propose any creative suggestions or additional insights for clarity.

  ### Step 3: Document Creation

  Compose a systematic document that should include:

  #### Essential Elements

  - **Overview:** Explanation of the code's purpose, functionality, and use cases.
  - **Architecture/Structure:** Description of the overall code structure and relationships among major components.
  - **Core Functionality Explanation:** Detailed description of major functions, classes, and modules.
  - **API Documentation (if applicable):** Parameters, return values, exception handling, etc.
  - **Usage Examples:** Clear examples demonstrating how to use the code.
  - **Easily Confused Parts:** Detailed explanations for sections prone to misunderstandings.
  - Additionally, use your creativity and initiative to think about what extra information would help the reader understand the provided code more easily, clearly, and quickly.

  #### Detailed Explanation of Confusing Elements and Precautions

  - Highlight code sections that are non-intuitive or likely to cause misunderstandings.
  - Explain potential performance implications, side effects, and error scenarios.
  - Describe common pitfalls developers might encounter and suggest solutions or improvements.

  ### Step 4: Document Review and Improvement

  Before finalizing the document, ensure that:

  - All key aspects of the code are clearly explained.
  - The document is organized logically and flows naturally.
  - Visual aids are effectively enhancing understanding.
  - Complex logics or non-intuitive structures are represented clearly with diagrams.
  - Potentially confusing or error-prone sections are sufficiently detailed.
  - The reader can confidently understand and apply the code after reading the document.
  - The document serves both beginners and advanced users with practical examples and detailed insights.

  ## Code Review

  **Purpose:**
  Assist the original developer by identifying not only areas for improvement but also uncovering potential issues that might have been overlooked. Focus on “what's wrong or could be improved” with an emphasis on detecting hidden problems.

  ### Review Focus Areas

  - **Potential Issues:**

    - Identify any potential errors, performance bottlenecks, or areas that may lead to future maintenance challenges.
    - Point out any ambiguous code segments or non-intuitive logic that could result in bugs.
    - Assess error handling, exception management, and resource utilization for weaknesses.

  - **Improvement Suggestions:**

    - Recommend better naming conventions, clearer code structure, and enhanced commenting.
    - Propose refactoring strategies to simplify complex logic.
    - Discuss alternatives for more efficient algorithms or data structures.

  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Highlight areas where test coverage might be insufficient.
    - Discuss scalability, security, and overall code robustness.
    - Suggest additional visual aids if they can help clarify complex interactions.

  ### Recording Your Findings

  - Record any findings, surprises, insights, or issues that the original author might have missed.
  - If no major issues exist, keep this section concise.
  - Utilize visual diagrams where necessary to illustrate potential pitfalls or better solutions.

  ## Tone & Style

  - 전부 한국어로 작성하라
  - **Apply markdown formatting to make it easier to skim**
  - Use **반말체 (informal speech)**: End sentences with "~이야" or "~해", etc.
  - **Bad Example:** "이 함수는 데이터를 검증합니다."
  - **Good Example:** "이 함수는 데이터를 검증해."
  - 또는 반말보다 명사형이 더 적절할 경우에는, 반말이 아닌 명사형으로 문장을 끝내.
  - 위의 모든 조건들의 목적은 이해를 더 쉽고 빠르게 만들기 위해서임.
