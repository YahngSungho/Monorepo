--- title: Public API of a component --- ### Public API of a component Svelte uses the `$props` rune to declare _properties_ or _props_, which means describing the public interface of the component which becomes accessible to consumers of the component. `svelte <script> let { foo, bar, baz } = $props(); // Values that are passed in as props // are immediately available console.log({ foo, bar, baz }); </script>` You can specify a fallback value for a prop. It will be used if the component's consumer doesn't specify the prop on the component when instantiating the component, or if the passed value is `undefined` at some point. `svelte <script> let { foo = 'optional default initial value' } = $props(); </script>` To get all properties, use rest syntax: `svelte <script> let { a, b, c, ...everythingElse } = $props(); </script>` You can use reserved words as prop names. ``svelte <script> // creates a `class` property, even // though it is a reserved word let { class: className } = $props(); </script>`` If you're using TypeScript, you can declare the prop types: `svelte <script lang="ts"> interface Props { required: string; optional?: number; key: string]: unknown; } let { required, optional, ...everythingElse }: Props = $props(); </script>` If you're using JavaScript, you can declare the prop types using JSDoc: `svelte <script> /** @type {{ x: string }} */ let { x } = $props(); // or use @typedef if you want to document the properties: /** * @typedef {Object} MyProps * @property {string} y Some documentation */ /** @type {MyProps} */ let { y } = $props(); </script>` If you export a `const`, `class` or `function`, it is readonly from outside the component. ``svelte <script> export const thisIs = 'readonly'; export function greet(name) { alert(`hello ${name}!`); } </script>`` Readonly props can be accessed as properties on the element, tied to the component using [`bind:this` syntax. ### Reactive variables To change component state and trigger a re-render, just assign to a locally declared variable that was declared using the `$state` rune. Update expressions (`count += 1`) and property assignments (`obj.x = y`) have the same effect. ``svelte <script> let count = $state(0); function handleClick() { // calling this function will trigger an // update if the markup references `count` count = count + 1; } </script>`` Svelte's `<script>` blocks are run only when the component is created, so assignments within a `<script>` block are not automatically run again when a prop updates. ``svelte <script> let { person } = $props(); // this will only set `name` on component creation // it will not update when `person` does let { name } = person; </script>`` If you'd like to react to changes to a prop, use the `$derived` or `$effect` runes instead. `svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let double = $derived(count * 2); $effect(() => { if (count > 10) { alert('Too high!'); } }); </script>` For more information on reactivity, read the documentation around runes.

## docs/svelte/01-introduction/xx-reactivity-fundamentals.md

--- title: Reactivity fundamentals --- Reactivity is at the heart of interactive UIs. When you click a button, you expect some kind of response. It's your job as a developer to make this happen. It's Svelte's job to make your job as intuitive as possible, by providing a good API to express reactive systems. ## Runes Svelte 5 uses _runes_, a powerful set of primitives for controlling reactivity inside your Svelte components and inside `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` modules. Runes are function-like symbols that provide instructions to the Svelte compiler. You don't need to import them from anywhere — when you use Svelte, they're part of the language. The following sections introduce the most important runes for declare state, derived state and side effects at a high level. For more details refer to the later sections on state and side effects. ## `$state` Reactive state is declared with the `$state` rune: `svelte <script> let count = $state(0); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> clicks: {count} </button>` You can also use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private): `js // @errors: 7006 2554 class Todo { done = $state(false); text = $state(); constructor(text) { this.text = text; } }` > In Svelte 4, state was implicitly reactive if the variable was declared at the top level > > `svelte > <script> > let count = 0; > </script> > > <button on:click={() => count++}> > clicks: {count} > </button> >` ## `$derived` Derived state is declared with the `$derived` rune: `svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $derived(count * 2); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> {doubled} </button> <p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p>` The expression inside `$derived(...)` should be free of side-effects. Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions. As with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`. > In Svelte 4, you could use reactive statements for this. > > `svelte > <script> > let count = 0; > $: doubled = count * 2; > </script> > > <button on:click={() => count++}> > {doubled} > </button> > > <p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p> >` > > This only worked at the top level of a component. ## `$effect` To run _side-effects_ when the component is mounted to the DOM, and when values change, we can use the `$effect` rune (demo): ``svelte <script> let size = $state(50); let color = $state('#ff3e00'); let canvas; $effect(() => { const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // this will re-run whenever `color` or `size` change context.fillStyle = color; context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size); }); </script> <canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100" />`` The function passed to `$effect` will run when the component mounts, and will re-run after any changes to the values it reads that were declared with `$state` or `$derived` (including those passed in with `$props`). Re-runs are batched (i.e. changing `color` and `size` in the same moment won't cause two separate runs), and happen after any DOM updates have been applied. > In Svelte 4, you could use reactive statements for this. > > ``svelte > <script> > let size = 50; > let color = '#ff3e00'; > > let canvas; > > $: { > const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); > context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); > > // this will re-run whenever `color` or `size` change > context.fillStyle = color; > context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size); > } > </script> > > <canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100" /> >`` > > This only worked at the top level of a component.

## docs/svelte/02-runes/01-what-are-runes.md

--- title: What are runes? --- > > A letter or mark used as a mystical or magic symbol. Runes are symbols that you use in `.svelte` and `.svelte.js`/`.svelte.ts` files to control the Svelte compiler. If you think of Svelte as a language, runes are part of the syntax — they are _keywords_. Runes have a `$` prefix and look like functions: `js let message = $state('hello');` They differ from normal JavaScript functions in important ways, however: - You don't need to import them — they are part of the language - They're not values — you can't assign them to a variable or pass them as arguments to a function - Just like JavaScript keywords, they are only valid in certain positions (the compiler will help you if you put them in the wrong place) > Runes didn't exist prior to Svelte 5.

## docs/svelte/02-runes/02-$state.md

--- title: $state --- The `$state`rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes. ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> clicks: {count} </button> ``` Unlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state —`count`is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable. ### Deep state If`$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. Proxies allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates. State is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object. In a case like this... ```js let todos = $state( { done: false, text: 'add more todos' } ]); ``` ...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property: ```js let todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }]; //cut todos[0].done = !todos[0].done; ``` If you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified: ```js let todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }]; //cut todos.push({ done: false, text: 'eat lunch' }); ``` Note that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring: ```js let todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }]; //cut let { done, text } = todos[0]; // this will not affect the value of `done` todos[0].done = !todos[0].done; ``` ### Classes You can also use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private): ```js // @errors: 7006 2554 class Todo { done = $state(false); text = $state(); constructor(text) { this.text = text; } reset() { this.text = ''; this.done = false; } } ``` When calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`matters. This won't work, because`this`inside the`reset`method will be the`<button>`rather than the`Todo`: ```svelte <button onclick={todo.reset}> reset </button> ``` You can either use an inline function... ```svelte <button onclick={() => todo.reset()}> reset </button> ``` ...or use an arrow function in the class definition: ```js // @errors: 7006 2554 class Todo { done = $state(false); text = $state(); constructor(text) { this.text = text; } reset = () => { this.text = ''; this.done = false; } } ``` ## `$state.raw` In cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`. State declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it: ```js let person = $state.raw({ name: 'Heraclitus', age: 49 }); // this will have no effect person.age += 1; // this will work, because we're creating a new person person = { name: 'Heraclitus', age: 50 }; ``` This can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects). ## `$state.snapshot`To take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive`$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`: ```svelte <script> let counter = $state({ count: 0 }); function onclick() { // Will log`{ count: ... }`rather than`Proxy { ... }`console.log($state.snapshot(counter)); } </script> ``` This is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as`structuredClone`. ## Passing state into functions JavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words: ```js /// file: index.js // @filename: index.js //cut /** * @param {number} a * @param {number} b */ function add(a, b) { return a + b; } let a = 1; let b = 2; let total = add(a, b); console.log(total); // 3 a = 3; b = 4; console.log(total); // still 3! ``` If`add`wanted to have access to the _current_ values of`a`and`b`, and to return the current`total`value, you would need to use functions instead: ```js /// file: index.js // @filename: index.js //cut /** * @param {() => number} getA * @param {() => number} getB */ function add(getA, getB) { return() => getA() + getB(); } let a = 1; let b = 2; let total = add(() => a, () => b); console.log(total()); // 3 a = 3; b = 4; console.log(total()); // 7 ``` State in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the`$state` rune... ```js let a =$state(1); let b =$state(2); ``...you're accessing its _current value_. Note that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and `get`/`set` properties...``js /// file: index.js // @filename: index.js //cut /\*\* _ @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input _/ function add(input) { return { get value() { return input.a + input.b; } }; } let input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 }); let total = add(input); console.log(total.value); // 3 input.a = 3; input.b = 4; console.log(total.value); // 7 ``` ...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using classes instead.

## docs/svelte/02-runes/03-$derived.md

--- title: $derived --- Derived state is declared with the `$derived`rune: ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $derived(count * 2); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> {doubled} </button> <p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p> ``` The expression inside`$derived(...)` should be free of side-effects. Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions. As with `$state`, you can mark class fields as`$derived`. ## `$derived.by`Sometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use`$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument. ```svelte <script> let numbers = $state(1, 2, 3]); let total = $derived.by(() => { let total = 0; for (const n of numbers) { total += n; } return total; }); </script> <button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}> {numbers.join(' + ')} = {total} </button> ``` In essence, `$derived(expression)`is equivalent to`$derived.by(() => expression)`. ## Understanding dependencies Anything read synchronously inside the `$derived`expression (or`$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read. To exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`. ## Overriding derived values Derived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with `const`). This can be useful for things like _optimistic UI_, where a value is derived from the 'source of truth' (such as data from your server) but you'd like to show immediate feedback to the user: ```svelte <script> let { post, like } = $props(); let likes = $derived(post.likes); async function onclick() { // increment the `likes` count immediately... likes += 1; // and tell the server, which will eventually update `post` try { await like(); } catch { // failed! roll back the change likes -= 1; } } </script> <button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button> ``` ## Deriveds and reactivity Unlike `$state`, which converts objects and arrays to deeply reactive proxies,`$derived`values are left as-is. For example, in a case like this... ```svelte let items = $state([...]); let index = $state(0); let selected = $derived(items[index]); ``` ...you can change (or`bind:`to) properties of`selected`and it will affect the underlying`items`array. If`items`was _not_ deeply reactive, mutating`selected`would have no effect. ## Update propagation Svelte uses something called _push-pull reactivity_ — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the 'push'), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the 'pull'). If the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when`large`changes, not when`count`changes, even though`large`depends on`count`: `svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let large = $derived(count > 10); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> {large} </button>`

## docs/svelte/02-runes/04-$effect.md

--- title: $effect --- Effects are functions that run when state updates, and can be used for things like calling third-party libraries, drawing on `<canvas>` elements, or making network requests. They only run in the browser, not during server-side rendering. Generally speaking, you should _not_ update state inside effects, as it will make code more convoluted and will often lead to never-ending update cycles. If you find yourself doing so, see when not to use `$effect`to learn about alternative approaches. You can create an effect with the`$effect` rune (demo): ```svelte <script> let size = $state(50); let color = $state('#ff3e00'); let canvas; $effect(() => { const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // this will re-run whenever `color` or `size` change context.fillStyle = color; context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size); }); </script> <canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100" /> ``` When Svelte runs an effect function, it tracks which pieces of state (and derived state) are accessed (unless accessed inside `untrack`), and re-runs the function when that state later changes. ### Understanding lifecycle Your effects run after the component has been mounted to the DOM, and in a microtask after state changes. Re-runs are batched (i.e. changing `color` and `size` in the same moment won't cause two separate runs), and happen after any DOM updates have been applied. You can use `$effect`anywhere, not just at the top level of a component, as long as it is called while a parent effect is running. An effect can return a _teardown function_ which will run immediately before the effect re-runs (demo). ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let milliseconds = $state(1000); $effect(() => { // This will be recreated whenever`milliseconds`changes const interval = setInterval(() => { count += 1; }, milliseconds); return () => { // if a teardown function is provided, it will run // a) immediately before the effect re-runs // b) when the component is destroyed clearInterval(interval); }; }); </script> <h1>{count}</h1> <button onclick={() => (milliseconds *= 2)}>slower</button> <button onclick={() => (milliseconds /= 2)}>faster</button> ``` Teardown functions also run when the effect is destroyed, which happens when its parent is destroyed (for example, a component is unmounted) or the parent effect re-runs. ### Understanding dependencies`$effect`automatically picks up any reactive values (`$state`, `$derived`,`$props`) that are _synchronously_ read inside its function body (including indirectly, via function calls) and registers them as dependencies. When those dependencies change, the `$effect` schedules a re-run. If `$state`and`$derived` are used directly inside the `$effect`(for example, during creation of a reactive class), those values will _not_ be treated as dependencies. Values that are read _asynchronously_ — after an`await`or inside a`setTimeout`, for example — will not be tracked. Here, the canvas will be repainted when `color`changes, but not when`size`changes (demo): ```ts // @filename: index.ts declare let canvas: { width: number; height: number; getContext(type: '2d', options?: CanvasRenderingContext2DSettings): CanvasRenderingContext2D; }; declare let color: string; declare let size: number; //cut $effect(() => { const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // this will re-run whenever`color`changes... context.fillStyle = color; setTimeout(() => { // ...but not when`size`changes context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size); }, 0); }); ``` An effect only reruns when the object it reads changes, not when a property inside it changes. (If you want to observe changes _inside_ an object at dev time, you can use`$inspect`.) ```svelte <script> let state = $state({ value: 0 }); let derived = $derived({ value: state.value * 2 }); // this will run once, because `state` is never reassigned (only mutated) $effect(() => { state; }); // this will run whenever `state.value` changes... $effect(() => { state.value; }); // ...and so will this, because `derived` is a new object each time $effect(() => { derived; }); </script> <button onclick={() => (state.value += 1)}> {state.value} </button> <p>{state.value} doubled is {derived.value}</p> ``` An effect only depends on the values that it read the last time it ran. This has interesting implications for effects that have conditional code. For instance, if `a` is `true` in the code snippet below, the code inside the `if` block will run and `b` will be evaluated. As such, changes to either `a` or `b` will cause the effect to re-run. Conversely, if `a` is `false`, `b` will not be evaluated, and the effect will _only_ re-run when `a` changes. ```ts let a = false; let b = false; //cut $effect(() => { console.log('running'); if (a) { console.log('b:', b); } }); ``` ## `$effect.pre`In rare cases, you may need to run code _before_ the DOM updates. For this we can use the`$effect.pre` rune: ```svelte <script> import { tick } from 'svelte'; let div = $state(); let messages = $state(]); // ... $effect.pre(() => { if (!div) return; // not yet mounted // reference `messages` array length so that this code re-runs whenever it changes messages.length; // autoscroll when new messages are added if (div.offsetHeight + div.scrollTop > div.scrollHeight - 20) { tick().then(() => { div.scrollTo(0, div.scrollHeight); }); } }); </script> <div bind:this={div}> {#each messages as message} <p>{message}</p> {/each} </div> ``` Apart from the timing, `$effect.pre`works exactly like`$effect`. ## `$effect.tracking`The`$effect.tracking` rune is an advanced feature that tells you whether or not the code is running inside a tracking context, such as an effect or inside your template ([demo): ```svelte <script> console.log('in component setup:', $effect.tracking()); // false $effect(() => { console.log('in effect:', $effect.tracking()); // true }); </script> <p>in template: {$effect.tracking()}</p> ``It is used to implement abstractions like `createSubscriber`, which will create listeners to update reactive values but _only_ if those values are being tracked (rather than, for example, read inside an event handler). ## `$effect.root` The `$effect.root` rune is an advanced feature that creates a non-tracked scope that doesn't auto-cleanup. This is useful for nested effects that you want to manually control. This rune also allows for the creation of effects outside of the component initialisation phase.``svelte <script> let count = $state(0); const cleanup = $effect.root(() => { $effect(() => { console.log(count); }); return () => { console.log('effect root cleanup'); }; }); </script> ``` ## When not to use `$effect`In general,`$effect` is best considered something of an escape hatch — useful for things like analytics and direct DOM manipulation — rather than a tool you should use frequently. In particular, avoid using it to synchronise state. Instead of this... ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $state(); // don't do this! $effect(() => { doubled = count * 2; }); </script> ``` ...do this: ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $derived(count * 2); </script> ``` If you're using an effect because you want to be able to reassign the derived value (to build an optimistic UI, for example) note that deriveds can be directly overridden as of Svelte 5.25. You might be tempted to do something convoluted with effects to link one value to another. The following example shows two inputs for "money spent" and "money left" that are connected to each other. If you update one, the other should update accordingly. Don't use effects for this (demo): ```svelte <script> let total = 100; let spent = $state(0); let left = $state(total); $effect(() => { left = total - spent; }); $effect(() => { spent = total - left; }); </script> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={spent} max={total} /> {spent}/{total} spent </label> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={left} max={total} /> {left}/{total} left </label> ``` Instead, use `oninput` callbacks or — better still — function bindings where possible (demo): ```svelte <script> let total = 100; let spent = $state(0); let left = $state(total); function updateSpent(value) { spent = value; left = total - spent; } function updateLeft(value) { left = value; spent = total - left; } </script> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={() => spent, updateSpent} max={total} /> {spent}/{total} spent </label> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={() => left, updateLeft} max={total} /> {left}/{total} left </label> ``` If you absolutely have to update `$state`within an effect and run into an infinite loop because you read and write to the same`$state`, use untrack.

## docs/svelte/02-runes/05-$props.md

--- title: $props --- The inputs to a component are referred to as _props_, which is short for _properties_. You pass props to components just like you pass attributes to elements: ```svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte'; </script> <MyComponent adjective="cool" /> ``` On the other side, inside `MyComponent.svelte`, we can receive props with the `$props`rune... ```svelte <!file: MyComponent.svelte> <script> let props = $props(); </script> <p>this component is {props.adjective}</p> ``` ...though more commonly, you'll _destructure_ your props: ```svelte <!file: MyComponent.svelte> <script> let{ adjective }= $props(); </script> <p>this component is {adjective}</p> ``` ## Fallback values Destructuring allows us to declare fallback values, which are used if the parent component does not set a given prop: ```js let { adjective = 'happy' } = $props(); ``` ## Renaming props We can also use the destructuring assignment to rename props, which is necessary if they're invalid identifiers, or a JavaScript keyword like`super`: ```js let { super: trouper = 'lights are gonna find me' } = $props(); ``` ## Rest props Finally, we can use a _rest property_ to get, well, the rest of the props: ```js let { a, b, c, ...others } = $props(); ``` ## Updating props References to a prop inside a component update when the prop itself updates — when`count`changes in`App.svelte`, it will also change inside`Child.svelte`. But the child component is able to temporarily override the prop value, which can be useful for unsaved ephemeral state (demo): ```svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import Child from './Child.svelte'; let count = $state(0); </script> <button onclick={() => (count += 1)}> clicks (parent): {count} </button> <Child {count} /> ``` ```svelte <!file: Child.svelte> <script> let { count } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => (count += 1)}> clicks (child): {count} </button> ``` While you can temporarily _reassign_ props, you should not _mutate_ props unless they are bindable. If the prop is a regular object, the mutation will have no effect (demo): ```svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import Child from './Child.svelte'; </script> <Child object={{ count: 0 }} /> ``` ```svelte <!file: Child.svelte> <script> let { object } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => { // has no effect object.count += 1 }}> clicks: {object.count} </button> ``` If the prop is a reactive state proxy, however, then mutations _will_ have an effect but you will see an`ownership_invalid_mutation`warning, because the component is mutating state that does not 'belong' to it (demo): ```svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import Child from './Child.svelte'; let object = $state({count: 0}); </script> <Child {object} /> ``` ```svelte <!file: Child.svelte> <script> let { object } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => { // will cause the count below to update, // but with a warning. Don't mutate // objects you don't own! object.count += 1 }}> clicks: {object.count} </button> ``` The fallback value of a prop not declared with`$bindable` is left untouched — it is not turned into a reactive state proxy — meaning mutations will not cause updates (demo) ```svelte <!file: Child.svelte> <script> let { object = { count: 0 } } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => { // has no effect if the fallback value is used object.count += 1 }}> clicks: {object.count} </button> ``` In summary: don't mutate props. Either use callback props to communicate changes, or — if parent and child should share the same object — use the `$bindable`rune. ## Type safety You can add type safety to your components by annotating your props, as you would with any other variable declaration. In TypeScript that might look like this... ```svelte <script lang="ts"> let { adjective }: { adjective: string } = $props(); </script> ``` ...while in JSDoc you can do this: ```svelte <script> /** @type {{ adjective: string }} */ let { adjective } = $props(); </script> ``` You can, of course, separate the type declaration from the annotation: ```svelte <script lang="ts"> interface Props { adjective: string; } let { adjective }: Props = $props(); </script> ``` Adding types is recommended, as it ensures that people using your component can easily discover which props they should provide. ##`$props.id()`This rune, added in version 5.20.0, generates an ID that is unique to the current component instance. When hydrating a server-rendered component, the value will be consistent between server and client. This is useful for linking elements via attributes like`for`and`aria-labelledby`.`svelte <script> const uid = $props.id(); </script> <form> <label for="{uid}-firstname">First Name: </label> <input id="{uid}-firstname" type="text" /> <label for="{uid}-lastname">Last Name: </label> <input id="{uid}-lastname" type="text" /> </form> `

## docs/svelte/02-runes/06-$bindable.md

--- title: $bindable --- Ordinarily, props go one way, from parent to child. This makes it easy to understand how data flows around your app. In Svelte, component props can be _bound_, which means that data can also flow _up_ from child to parent. This isn't something you should do often, but it can simplify your code if used sparingly and carefully. It also means that a state proxy can be _mutated_ in the child. To mark a prop as bindable, we use the `$bindable`rune: ```svelte /// file: FancyInput.svelte <script> let { value = $bindable(), ...props } = $props(); </script> <input bind:value={value} {...props} /> <style> input { font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; color: deeppink; } </style> ``` Now, a component that uses`<FancyInput>`can add the`bind:`directive (demo): ```svelte /// file: App.svelte <script> import FancyInput from './FancyInput.svelte'; let message = $state('hello'); </script> <FancyInput bind:value={message} /> <p>{message}</p> ``` The parent component doesn't _have_ to use`bind:`— it can just pass a normal prop. Some parents don't want to listen to what their children have to say. In this case, you can specify a fallback value for when no prop is passed at all:`js /// file: FancyInput.svelte let { value = $bindable('fallback'), ...props } = $props(); `

## docs/svelte/02-runes/08-$host.md

--- title: $host --- When compiling a component as a custom element, the `$host`rune provides access to the host element, allowing you to (for example) dispatch custom events (demo):`svelte /// file: Stepper.svelte <svelte:options customElement="my-stepper" /> <script> function dispatch(type) { $host().dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(type)); } </script> <button onclick={() => dispatch('decrement')}>decrement</button> <button onclick={() => dispatch('increment')}>increment</button> ` `svelte /// file: App.svelte <script> import './Stepper.svelte'; let count = $state(0); </script> <my-stepper ondecrement={() => count -= 1} onincrement={() => count += 1} ></my-stepper> <p>count: {count}</p> `

--- title: Template syntax ---

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/02-if.md

--- title: {#if ...} --- `svelte <!copy: false> {#if expression}...{/if}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#if expression}...{:else if expression}...{/if}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#if expression}...{:else}...{/if}` Content that is conditionally rendered can be wrapped in an if block. `svelte {#if answer === 42} <p>what was the question?</p> {/if}` Additional conditions can be added with `{:else if expression}`, optionally ending in an `{:else}` clause. `svelte {#if porridge.temperature > 100} <p>too hot!</p> {:else if 80 > porridge.temperature} <p>too cold!</p> {:else} <p>just right!</p> {/if}` (Blocks don't have to wrap elements, they can also wrap text within elements.)

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/03-each.md

--- title: {#each ...} --- `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name, index}...{/each}` Iterating over values can be done with an each block. The values in question can be arrays, array-like objects (i.e. anything with a `length` property), or iterables like `Map` and `Set` — in other words, anything that can be used with `Array.from`. `svelte <h1>Shopping list</h1> <ul> {#each items as item} <li>{item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each} </ul>` An each block can also specify an _index_, equivalent to the second argument in an `array.map(...)` callback: `svelte {#each items as item, i} <li>{i + 1}: {item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each}` ## Keyed each blocks `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name (key)}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name, index (key)}...{/each}` If a _key_ expression is provided — which must uniquely identify each list item — Svelte will use it to diff the list when data changes, rather than adding or removing items at the end. The key can be any object, but strings and numbers are recommended since they allow identity to persist when the objects themselves change. `svelte {#each items as item (item.id)} <li>{item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each} {#each items as item, i (item.id)} <li>{i + 1}: {item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each}` You can freely use destructuring and rest patterns in each blocks. `svelte {#each items as { id, name, qty }, i (id)} <li>{i + 1}: {name} x {qty}</li> {/each} {#each objects as { id, ...rest }} <li><span>{id}</span><MyComponent {...rest} /></li> {/each} {#each items as id, ...rest]} <li><span>{id}</span><MyComponent values={rest} /></li> {/each}` ## Each blocks without an item `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression, index}...{/each}` In case you just want to render something `n` times, you can omit the `as` part ([demo): `svelte <div class="chess-board"> {#each { length: 8 }, rank} {#each { length: 8 }, file} <div class:black={(rank + file) % 2 === 1}></div> {/each} {/each} </div>` ## Else blocks `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name}...{:else}...{/each}` An each block can also have an `{:else}` clause, which is rendered if the list is empty. `svelte {#each todos as todo} <p>{todo.text}</p> {:else} <p>No tasks today!</p> {/each}`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/04-key.md

--- title: {#key ...} --- `svelte <!copy: false> {#key expression}...{/key}` Key blocks destroy and recreate their contents when the value of an expression changes. When used around components, this will cause them to be reinstantiated and reinitialised: `svelte {#key value} <Component /> {/key}` It's also useful if you want a transition to play whenever a value changes: `svelte {#key value} <div transition:fade>{value}</div> {/key}`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/05-await.md

--- title: {#await ...} --- `svelte <!copy: false> {#await expression}...{:then name}...{:catch name}...{/await}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#await expression}...{:then name}...{/await}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#await expression then name}...{/await}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#await expression catch name}...{/await}` Await blocks allow you to branch on the three possible states of a `Promise` — pending, fulfilled or rejected. `svelte {#await promise} <p>waiting for the promise to resolve...</p> {:then value} <p>The value is {value}</p> {:catch error} <p>Something went wrong: {error.message}</p> {/await}` > > If the provided expression is not a `Promise`, only the `:then` branch will be rendered, including during server-side rendering. The `catch` block can be omitted if you don't need to render anything when the promise rejects (or no error is possible). `svelte {#await promise} <p>waiting for the promise to resolve...</p> {:then value} <p>The value is {value}</p> {/await}` If you don't care about the pending state, you can also omit the initial block. `svelte {#await promise then value} <p>The value is {value}</p> {/await}` Similarly, if you only want to show the error state, you can omit the `then` block. `svelte {#await promise catch error} <p>The error is {error}</p> {/await}` > > `svelte > {#await import('./Component.svelte') then { default: Component }} > <Component /> > {/await} >`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/06-snippet.md

--- title: {#snippet ...} --- `svelte <!copy: false> {#snippet name()}...{/snippet}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#snippet name(param1, param2, paramN)}...{/snippet}` Snippets, and render tags, are a way to create reusable chunks of markup inside your components. Instead of writing duplicative code like this... `svelte {#each images as image} {#if image.href} <a href={image.href}> <figure> <img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} /> <figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption> </figure> </a> {:else} <figure> <img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} /> <figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption> </figure> {/if} {/each}` ...you can write this: `svelte {#snippet figure(image)} <figure> <img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} /> <figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption> </figure> {/snippet} {#each images as image} {#if image.href} <a href={image.href}> {@render figure(image)} </a> {:else} {@render figure(image)} {/if} {/each}` Like function declarations, snippets can have an arbitrary number of parameters, which can have default values, and you can destructure each parameter. You cannot use rest parameters, however. ## Snippet scope Snippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks (demo)... ``svelte <script> let { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props(); </script> {#snippet hello(name)} <p>hello {name}! {message}!</p> {/snippet} {@render hello('alice')} {@render hello('bob')}`` ...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings): `svelte <div> {#snippet x()} {#snippet y()}...{/snippet} {@render y()} {/snippet} {@render y()} </div> {@render x()}` Snippets can reference themselves and each other (demo): `svelte {#snippet blastoff()} <span>🚀</span> {/snippet} {#snippet countdown(n)} {#if n > 0} <span>{n}...</span> {@render countdown(n - 1)} {:else} {@render blastoff()} {/if} {/snippet} {@render countdown(10)}` ## Passing snippets to components Within the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props (demo): `svelte <script> import Table from './Table.svelte'; const fruits =  { name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 }, { name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 }, { name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 } ]; </script> {#snippet header()} <th>fruit</th> <th>qty</th> <th>price</th> <th>total</th> {/snippet} {#snippet row(d)} <td>{d.name}</td> <td>{d.qty}</td> <td>{d.price}</td> <td>{d.qty * d.price}</td> {/snippet} <Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />` Think about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components. As an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo): ```svelte <Table data={fruits}> {#snippet header()} <th>fruit</th> <th>qty</th> <th>price</th> <th>total</th> {/snippet} {#snippet row(d)} <td>{d.name}</td> <td>{d.qty}</td> <td>{d.price}</td> <td>{d.qty * d.price}</td> {/snippet} </Table>``` Any content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet (demo): ```svelte <!file: App.svelte> <Button>click me</Button>``` ```svelte <!file: Button.svelte> <script> let { children } = $props(); </script> <button>{@render children()}</button>``` You can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set... ```svelte <script> let { children } = $props(); </script> {@render children?.()}``` ...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content: ```svelte <script> let { children } = $props(); </script> {#if children} {@render children()} {:else} fallback content {/if}``` ## Typing snippets Snippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`: ```svelte <script lang="ts"> import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'; interface Props { data: any]; children: Snippet; row: Snippet<[any]>; } let { data, children, row }: Props = $props(); </script> ``With this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters. We can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:``svelte <script lang="ts" generics="T"> import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'; let { data, children, row }: { data: T[]; children: Snippet; row: Snippet<[T]>; } = $props(); </script> ``## Exporting snippets Snippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo):``svelte <script module> export { add }; </script> {#snippet add(a, b)} {a} + {b} = {a + b} {/snippet}```> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer ## Programmatic snippets Snippets can be created programmatically with the`createRawSnippet` API. This is intended for advanced use cases. ## Snippets and slots In Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using slots. Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and as such slots are deprecated in Svelte 5.

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/07-@render.md

--- title: {@render ...} --- To render a snippet, use a `{@render ...}` tag. `svelte {#snippet sum(a, b)} <p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p> {/snippet} {@render sum(1, 2)} {@render sum(3, 4)} {@render sum(5, 6)}` The expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression: `svelte {@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}` ## Optional snippets If the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined: `svelte {@render children?.()}` Alternatively, use an `{#if ...}` block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content: `svelte {#if children} {@render children()} {:else} <p>fallback content</p> {/if}`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/08-@html.md

--- title: {@html ...} --- To inject raw HTML into your component, use the `{@html ...}` tag: `svelte <article> {@html content} </article>` The expression should be valid standalone HTML — this will not work, because `</div>` is not valid HTML: `svelte {@html '<div>'}content{@html '</div>'}` It also will not compile Svelte code. ## Styling Content rendered this way is 'invisible' to Svelte and as such will not receive scoped styles — in other words, this will not work, and the `a` and `img` styles will be regarded as unused: `svelte <article> {@html content} </article> <style> article { a { color: hotpink } img { width: 100% } } </style>` Instead, use the `:global` modifier to target everything inside the `<article>`: `svelte <style> article:global{ a { color: hotpink } img { width: 100% } } </style>`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/09-@const.md

--- title: {@const ...} --- The `{@const ...}` tag defines a local constant. `svelte {#each boxes as box} {@const area = box.width * box.height} {box.width} * {box.height} = {area} {/each}` `{@const}` is only allowed as an immediate child of a block — `{#if ...}`, `{#each ...}`, `{#snippet ...}` and so on — a `<Component />` or a `<svelte:boundary>`.

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/10-@debug.md

--- title: {@debug ...} --- The `{@debug ...}` tag offers an alternative to `console.log(...)`. It logs the values of specific variables whenever they change, and pauses code execution if you have devtools open. `svelte <script> let user = { firstname: 'Ada', lastname: 'Lovelace' }; </script> {@debug user} <h1>Hello {user.firstname}!</h1>` `{@debug ...}` accepts a comma-separated list of variable names (not arbitrary expressions). `svelte {@debug user} {@debug user1, user2, user3} {@debug user.firstname} {@debug myArray[0]} {@debug !isReady} {@debug typeof user === 'object'}` The `{@debug}` tag without any arguments will insert a `debugger` statement that gets triggered when _any_ state changes, as opposed to the specified variables.

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/11-bind.md

--- title: bind: --- Data ordinarily flows down, from parent to child. The `bind:` directive allows data to flow the other way, from child to parent. The general syntax is `bind:property={expression}`, where `expression` is an _lvalue_ (i.e. a variable or an object property). When the expression is an identifier with the same name as the property, we can omit the expression — in other words these are equivalent: `svelte <input bind:value={value} /> <input bind:value />` Svelte creates an event listener that updates the bound value. If an element already has a listener for the same event, that listener will be fired before the bound value is updated. Most bindings are _two-way_, meaning that changes to the value will affect the element and vice versa. A few bindings are _readonly_, meaning that changing their value will have no effect on the element. ## Function bindings You can also use `bind:property={get, set}`, where `get` and `set` are functions, allowing you to perform validation and transformation: `svelte <input bind:value={ () => value, (v) => value = v.toLowerCase()} />` In the case of readonly bindings like dimension bindings, the `get` value should be `null`: `svelte <div bind:clientWidth={null, redraw} bind:clientHeight={null, redraw} >...</div>` > Function bindings are available in Svelte 5.9.0 and newer. ## `<input bind:value>` A `bind:value` directive on an `<input>` element binds the input's `value` property: `svelte <script> let message = $state('hello'); </script> <input bind:value={message} /> <p>{message}</p>` In the case of a numeric input (`type="number"` or `type="range"`), the value will be coerced to a number (demo): `svelte <script> let a = $state(1); let b = $state(2); </script> <label> <input type="number" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" /> <input type="range" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" /> </label> <label> <input type="number" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" /> <input type="range" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" /> </label> <p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>` If the input is empty or invalid (in the case of `type="number"`), the value is `undefined`. Since 5.6.0, if an `<input>` has a `defaultValue` and is part of a form, it will revert to that value instead of the empty string when the form is reset. Note that for the initial render the value of the binding takes precedence unless it is `null` or `undefined`. `svelte <script> let value = $state(''); </script> <form> <input bind:value defaultValue="not the empty string"> <input type="reset" value="Reset"> </form>` > Use reset buttons sparingly, and ensure that users won't accidentally click them while trying to submit the form. ## `<input bind:checked>` Checkbox and radio inputs can be bound with `bind:checked`: `svelte <label> <input type="checkbox" bind:checked={accepted} /> Accept terms and conditions </label>` Since 5.6.0, if an `<input>` has a `defaultChecked` attribute and is part of a form, it will revert to that value instead of `false` when the form is reset. Note that for the initial render the value of the binding takes precedence unless it is `null` or `undefined`. `svelte <script> let checked = $state(true); </script> <form> <input type="checkbox" bind:checked defaultChecked={true}> <input type="reset" value="Reset"> </form>` ## `<input bind:group>` Inputs that work together can use `bind:group`. `svelte <script> let tortilla = $state('Plain'); /** @type {Array<string>} */ let fillings = $state(]); </script> <input type="radio" bind:group={tortilla} value="Plain" /> <input type="radio" bind:group={tortilla} value="Whole wheat" /> <input type="radio" bind:group={tortilla} value="Spinach" /> <input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Rice" /> <input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Beans" /> <input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Cheese" /> <input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Guac (extra)" />` ## `<input bind:files>` On `<input>` elements with `type="file"`, you can use `bind:files` to get the [`FileList` of selected files. When you want to update the files programmatically, you always need to use a `FileList` object. Currently `FileList` objects cannot be constructed directly, so you need to create a new `DataTransfer` object and get `files` from there. `svelte <script> let files = $state(); function clear() { files = new DataTransfer().files; // null or undefined does not work } </script> <label for="avatar">Upload a picture:</label> <input accept="image/png, image/jpeg" bind:files id="avatar" name="avatar" type="file" /> <button onclick={clear}>clear</button>` `FileList` objects also cannot be modified, so if you want to e.g. delete a single file from the list, you need to create a new `DataTransfer` object and add the files you want to keep. ## `<select bind:value>` A `<select>` value binding corresponds to the `value` property on the selected `<option>`, which can be any value (not just strings, as is normally the case in the DOM). `svelte <select bind:value={selected}> <option value={a}>a</option> <option value={b}>b</option> <option value={c}>c</option> </select>` A `<select multiple>` element behaves similarly to a checkbox group. The bound variable is an array with an entry corresponding to the `value` property of each selected `<option>`. `svelte <select multiple bind:value={fillings}> <option value="Rice">Rice</option> <option value="Beans">Beans</option> <option value="Cheese">Cheese</option> <option value="Guac (extra)">Guac (extra)</option> </select>` When the value of an `<option>` matches its text content, the attribute can be omitted. `svelte <select multiple bind:value={fillings}> <option>Rice</option> <option>Beans</option> <option>Cheese</option> <option>Guac (extra)</option> </select>` You can give the `<select>` a default value by adding a `selected` attribute to the`<option>` (or options, in the case of `<select multiple>`) that should be initially selected. If the `<select>` is part of a form, it will revert to that selection when the form is reset. Note that for the initial render the value of the binding takes precedence if it's not `undefined`. `svelte <select bind:value={selected}> <option value={a}>a</option> <option value={b} selected>b</option> <option value={c}>c</option> </select>` ## `<audio>` `<audio>` elements have their own set of bindings — five two-way ones... - `currentTime` - `playbackRate` - `paused` - `volume` - `muted` ...and six readonly ones: - `duration` - `buffered` - `seekable` - `seeking` - `ended` - `readyState` `svelte <audio src={clip} bind:duration bind:currentTime bind:paused></audio>` ## `<video>` `<video>` elements have all the same bindings as `<audio>` elements, plus readonly `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` bindings. ## `<img>` `<img>` elements have two readonly bindings: - `naturalWidth` - `naturalHeight` ## `<details bind:open>` `<details>` elements support binding to the `open` property. `svelte <details bind:open={isOpen}> <summary>How do you comfort a JavaScript bug?</summary> <p>You console it.</p> </details>` ## Contenteditable bindings Elements with the `contenteditable` attribute support the following bindings: - `innerHTML` - `innerText` - `textContent` `svelte <div contenteditable="true" bind:innerHTML={html}></div>` ## Dimensions All visible elements have the following readonly bindings, measured with a `ResizeObserver`: - `clientWidth` - `clientHeight` - `offsetWidth` - `offsetHeight` `svelte <div bind:offsetWidth={width} bind:offsetHeight={height}> <Chart {width} {height} /> </div>` ## bind:this `svelte <!copy: false> bind:this={dom_node}` To get a reference to a DOM node, use `bind:this`. The value will be `undefined` until the component is mounted — in other words, you should read it inside an effect or an event handler, but not during component initialisation: `svelte <script> /** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */ let canvas; $effect(() => { const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); drawStuff(ctx); }); </script> <canvas bind:this={canvas}></canvas>` Components also support `bind:this`, allowing you to interact with component instances programmatically. `svelte <!file: App.svelte> <ShoppingCart bind:this={cart} /> <button onclick={() => cart.empty()}> Empty shopping cart </button>` `svelte <!file: ShoppingCart.svelte> <script> // All instance exports are available on the instance object export function empty() { // ... } </script>` ## bind:_property_ for components `svelte bind:property={variable}` You can bind to component props using the same syntax as for elements. `svelte <Keypad bind:value={pin} />` While Svelte props are reactive without binding, that reactivity only flows downward into the component by default. Using `bind:property` allows changes to the property from within the component to flow back up out of the component. To mark a property as bindable, use the `$bindable` rune: `svelte <script> let { readonlyProperty, bindableProperty = $bindable() } = $props(); </script>` Declaring a property as bindable means it _can_ be used using `bind:`, not that it _must_ be used using `bind:`. Bindable properties can have a fallback value: `svelte <script> let { bindableProperty = $bindable('fallback value') } = $props(); </script>` This fallback value _only_ applies when the property is _not_ bound. When the property is bound and a fallback value is present, the parent is expected to provide a value other than `undefined`, else a runtime error is thrown. This prevents hard-to-reason-about situations where it's unclear which value should apply.

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/12-use.md

--- title: use: --- Actions are functions that are called when an element is mounted. They are added with the `use:` directive, and will typically use an `$effect` so that they can reset any state when the element is unmounted: `svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> /** @type {import('svelte/action').Action} */ function myaction(node) { // the node has been mounted in the DOM $effect(() => { // setup goes here return () => { // teardown goes here }; }); } </script> <div use:myaction>...</div>` An action can be called with an argument: `svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> /** @type {import('svelte/action').Action} */ function myaction(node,data) { // ... } </script> <div use:myaction={data}>...</div>` The action is only called once (but not during server-side rendering) — it will _not_ run again if the argument changes. > Prior to the `$effect` rune, actions could return an object with `update` and `destroy` methods, where `update` would be called with the latest value of the argument if it changed. Using effects is preferred. ## Typing The `Action` interface receives three optional type arguments — a node type (which can be `Element`, if the action applies to everything), a parameter, and any custom event handlers created by the action: `svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> /** * @type {import('svelte/action').Action< * HTMLDivElement, * undefined, * { * onswiperight: (e: CustomEvent) => void; * onswipeleft: (e: CustomEvent) => void; * // ... * } * >} */ function gestures(node) { $effect(() => { // ... node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('swipeleft')); // ... node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('swiperight')); }); } </script> <div use:gestures onswipeleft={next} onswiperight={prev} >...</div>`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/13-transition.md

--- title: transition: --- A _transition_ is triggered by an element entering or leaving the DOM as a result of a state change. When a block (such as an `{#if ...}` block) is transitioning out, all elements inside it, including those that do not have their own transitions, are kept in the DOM until every transition in the block has been completed. The `transition:` directive indicates a _bidirectional_ transition, which means it can be smoothly reversed while the transition is in progress. `svelte <script> import { fade } from 'svelte/transition'; let visible = $state(false); </script> <button onclick={() => visible = !visible}>toggle</button> {#if visible} <divtransition:fade>fades in and out</div> {/if}` ## Built-in transitions A selection of built-in transitions can be imported from the `svelte/transition` module. ## Local vs global Transitions are local by default. Local transitions only play when the block they belong to is created or destroyed, _not_ when parent blocks are created or destroyed. `svelte {#if x} {#if y} <p transition:fade>fades in and out only when y changes</p> <p transition:fade|global>fades in and out when x or y change</p> {/if} {/if}` ## Transition parameters Transitions can have parameters. (The double `{{curlies}}` aren't a special syntax; this is an object literal inside an expression tag.) `svelte {#if visible} <div transition:fade={{ duration: 2000 }}>fades in and out over two seconds</div> {/if}` ## Custom transition functions `js /// copy: false // @noErrors transition = (node: HTMLElement, params: any, options: { direction: 'in' | 'out' | 'both' }) => { delay?: number, duration?: number, easing?: (t: number) => number, css?: (t: number, u: number) => string, tick?: (t: number, u: number) => void }` Transitions can use custom functions. If the returned object has a `css` function, Svelte will generate keyframes for a web animation. The `t` argument passed to `css` is a value between `0` and `1` after the `easing` function has been applied. _In_ transitions run from `0` to `1`, _out_ transitions run from `1` to `0` — in other words, `1` is the element's natural state, as though no transition had been applied. The `u` argument is equal to `1 - t`. The function is called repeatedly _before_ the transition begins, with different `t` and `u` arguments. ``svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import { elasticOut } from 'svelte/easing'; /** @type {boolean} */ export let visible; /** * @param {HTMLElement} node * @param {{ delay?: number, duration?: number, easing?: (t: number) => number }} params */ function whoosh(node, params) { const existingTransform = getComputedStyle(node).transform.replace('none', ''); return { delay: params.delay || 0, duration: params.duration || 400, easing: params.easing || elasticOut, css: (t, u) => `transform: ${existingTransform} scale(${t})` }; } </script> {#if visible} <div in:whoosh>whooshes in</div> {/if}`` A custom transition function can also return a `tick` function, which is called _during_ the transition with the same `t` and `u` arguments. ``svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> export let visible = false; /** * @param {HTMLElement} node * @param {{ speed?: number }} params */ function typewriter(node, { speed = 1 }) { const valid = node.childNodes.length === 1 && node.childNodes0].nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE; if (!valid) { throw new Error(`This transition only works on elements with a single text node child`); } const text = node.textContent; const duration = text.length / (speed * 0.01); return { duration, tick: (t) => { const i = ~~(text.length * t); node.textContent = text.slice(0, i); } }; } </script> {#if visible} <p in:typewriter={{ speed: 1 }}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p> {/if}`` If a transition returns a function instead of a transition object, the function will be called in the next microtask. This allows multiple transitions to coordinate, making [crossfade effects possible. Transition functions also receive a third argument, `options`, which contains information about the transition. Available values in the `options` object are: - `direction` - one of `in`, `out`, or `both` depending on the type of transition ## Transition events An element with transitions will dispatch the following events in addition to any standard DOM events: - `introstart` - `introend` - `outrostart` - `outroend` `svelte {#if visible} <p transition:fly={{ y: 200, duration: 2000 }} onintrostart={() => (status = 'intro started')} onoutrostart={() => (status = 'outro started')} onintroend={() => (status = 'intro ended')} onoutroend={() => (status = 'outro ended')} > Flies in and out </p> {/if}`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/14-in-and-out.md

--- title: in: and out: --- The `in:` and `out:` directives are identical to `transition:`, except that the resulting transitions are not bidirectional — an `in` transition will continue to 'play' alongside the `out` transition, rather than reversing, if the block is outroed while the transition is in progress. If an out transition is aborted, transitions will restart from scratch. `svelte <script> import { fade, fly } from 'svelte/transition'; let visible = $state(false); </script> <label> <input type="checkbox" bind:checked={visible}> visible </label> {#if visible} <div in:fly={{ y: 200 }} out:fade>flies in, fades out</div> {/if}`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/15-animate.md

--- title: animate: --- An animation is triggered when the contents of a keyed each block are re-ordered. Animations do not run when an element is added or removed, only when the index of an existing data item within the each block changes. Animate directives must be on an element that is an _immediate_ child of a keyed each block. Animations can be used with Svelte's built-in animation functions or custom animation functions. `svelte {#each list as item, index (item)} <li animate:flip>{item}</li> {/each}` ## Animation Parameters As with actions and transitions, animations can have parameters. (The double `{{curlies}}` aren't a special syntax; this is an object literal inside an expression tag.) `svelte {#each list as item, index (item)} <li animate:flip={{ delay: 500 }}>{item}</li> {/each}` ## Custom animation functions `js /// copy: false // @noErrors animation = (node: HTMLElement, { from: DOMRect, to: DOMRect } , params: any) => { delay?: number, duration?: number, easing?: (t: number) => number, css?: (t: number, u: number) => string, tick?: (t: number, u: number) => void }` Animations can use custom functions that provide the `node`, an `animation` object and any `parameters` as arguments. The `animation` parameter is an object containing `from` and `to` properties each containing a DOMRect describing the geometry of the element in its `start` and `end` positions. The `from` property is the DOMRect of the element in its starting position, and the `to` property is the DOMRect of the element in its final position after the list has been reordered and the DOM updated. If the returned object has a `css` method, Svelte will create a web animation that plays on the element. The `t` argument passed to `css` is a value that goes from `0` and `1` after the `easing` function has been applied. The `u` argument is equal to `1 - t`. The function is called repeatedly _before_ the animation begins, with different `t` and `u` arguments. ``svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing'; /** * @param {HTMLElement} node * @param {{ from: DOMRect; to: DOMRect }} states * @param {any} params */ function whizz(node, { from, to }, params) { const dx = from.left - to.left; const dy = from.top - to.top; const d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy); return { delay: 0, duration: Math.sqrt(d) * 120, easing: cubicOut, css: (t, u) => `transform: translate(${u * dx}px, ${u * dy}px) rotate(${t * 360}deg);` }; } </script> {#each list as item, index (item)} <div animate:whizz>{item}</div> {/each}`` A custom animation function can also return a `tick` function, which is called _during_ the animation with the same `t` and `u` arguments. `svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing'; /** * @param {HTMLElement} node * @param {{ from: DOMRect; to: DOMRect }} states * @param {any} params */ function whizz(node, { from, to }, params) { const dx = from.left - to.left; const dy = from.top - to.top; const d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy); return { delay: 0, duration: Math.sqrt(d) * 120, easing: cubicOut, tick: (t, u) => Object.assign(node.style, { color: t > 0.5 ? 'Pink' : 'Blue' }) }; } </script> {#each list as item, index (item)} <div animate:whizz>{item}</div> {/each}`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/17-style.md

--- title: style: --- The `style:` directive provides a shorthand for setting multiple styles on an element. `svelte <div style:color="red">...</div> <div style="color: red;">...</div>` The value can contain arbitrary expressions: `svelte <div style:color={myColor}>...</div>` The shorthand form is allowed: `svelte <div style:color>...</div>` Multiple styles can be set on a single element: `svelte <div style:color style:width="12rem" style:background-color={darkMode ? 'black' : 'white'}>...</div>` To mark a style as important, use the `|important` modifier: `svelte <div style:color|important="red">...</div>` When `style:` directives are combined with `style` attributes, the directives will take precedence: `svelte <div style="color: blue;" style:color="red">This will be red</div>`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/18-class.md

--- title: class --- There are two ways to set classes on elements: the `class` attribute, and the `class:` directive. ## Attributes Primitive values are treated like any other attribute: `svelte <div class={large ? 'large' : 'small'}>...</div>` > For historical reasons, falsy values (like `false` and `NaN`) are stringified (`class="false"`), though `class={undefined}` (or `null`) cause the attribute to be omitted altogether. In a future version of Svelte, all falsy values will cause `class` to be omitted. ### Objects and arrays Since Svelte 5.16, `class` can be an object or array, and is converted to a string using clsx. If the value is an object, the truthy keys are added: `svelte <script> let { cool } = $props(); </script> <div class={{ cool, lame: !cool }}>...</div>` If the value is an array, the truthy values are combined: `svelte <div class={[faded && 'saturate-0 opacity-50', large && 'scale-200']}>...</div>` Note that whether we're using the array or object form, we can set multiple classes simultaneously with a single condition, which is particularly useful if you're using things like Tailwind. Arrays can contain arrays and objects, and clsx will flatten them. This is useful for combining local classes with props, for example: `svelte <!file: Button.svelte> <script> let props = $props(); </script> <button {...props} class={['cool-button', props.class]}> {@render props.children?.()} </button>` The user of this component has the same flexibility to use a mixture of objects, arrays and strings: `svelte <!file: App.svelte> <script> import Button from './Button.svelte'; let useTailwind = $state(false); </script> <Button onclick={() => useTailwind = true} class={{ 'bg-blue-700 sm:w-1/2': useTailwind }} > Accept the inevitability of Tailwind </Button>` Svelte also exposes the `ClassValue` type, which is the type of value that the `class` attribute on elements accept. This is useful if you want to use a type-safe class name in component props: `svelte <script lang="ts"> import type { ClassValue } from 'svelte/elements'; const props: { class: ClassValue } = $props(); </script> <div class={['original', props.class]}>...</div>` ## The `class:` directive Prior to Svelte 5.16, the `class:` directive was the most convenient way to set classes on elements conditionally. `svelte <div class={{ cool, lame: !cool }}>...</div> <div class:cool={cool} class:lame={!cool}>...</div>` As with other directives, we can use a shorthand when the name of the class coincides with the value: `svelte <div class:cool class:lame={!cool}>...</div>`

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/xx-control-flow.md

--- title: Control flow --- - if - each - await (or move that into some kind of data loading section?) - NOT: key (move into transition section, because that's the common use case) Svelte augments HTML with control flow blocks to be able to express conditionally rendered content or lists. The syntax between these blocks is the same: - `{#` denotes the start of a block - `{:` denotes a different branch part of the block. Depending on the block, there can be multiple of these - `{/` denotes the end of a block ## {#if ...} ## {#each ...} `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name, index}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name (key)}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name, index (key)}...{/each}` `svelte <!copy: false> {#each expression as name}...{:else}...{/each}` Iterating over lists of values can be done with an each block. `svelte <h1>Shopping list</h1> <ul> {#each items as item} <li>{item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each} </ul>` You can use each blocks to iterate over any array or array-like value — that is, any object with a `length` property. An each block can also specify an _index_, equivalent to the second argument in an `array.map(...)` callback: `svelte {#each items as item, i} <li>{i + 1}: {item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each}` If a _key_ expression is provided — which must uniquely identify each list item — Svelte will use it to diff the list when data changes, rather than adding or removing items at the end. The key can be any object, but strings and numbers are recommended since they allow identity to persist when the objects themselves change. `svelte {#each items as item (item.id)} <li>{item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each} {#each items as item, i (item.id)} <li>{i + 1}: {item.name} x {item.qty}</li> {/each}` You can freely use destructuring and rest patterns in each blocks. `svelte {#each items as { id, name, qty }, i (id)} <li>{i + 1}: {name} x {qty}</li> {/each} {#each objects as { id, ...rest }} <li><span>{id}</span><MyComponent {...rest} /></li> {/each} {#each items as id, ...rest]} <li><span>{id}</span><MyComponent values={rest} /></li> {/each}` An each block can also have an `{:else}` clause, which is rendered if the list is empty. `svelte {#each todos as todo} <p>{todo.text}</p> {:else} <p>No tasks today!</p> {/each}` It is possible to iterate over iterables like `Map` or `Set`. Iterables need to be finite and static (they shouldn't change while being iterated over). Under the hood, they are transformed to an array using `Array.from` before being passed off to rendering. If you're writing performance-sensitive code, try to avoid iterables and use regular arrays as they are more performant. ## Other block types Svelte also provides [`#snippet`, `#key` and `#await` blocks. You can find out more about them in their respective sections.

## docs/svelte/03-template-syntax/xx-data-fetching.md

--- title: Data fetching --- Fetching data is a fundamental part of apps interacting with the outside world. Svelte is unopinionated with how you fetch your data. The simplest way would be using the built-in `fetch` method: `svelte <script> let response = $state(); fetch('/api/data').then(async (r) => (response = r.json())); </script>` While this works, it makes working with promises somewhat unergonomic. Svelte alleviates this problem using the `#await` block. ## {#await ...} ## SvelteKit loaders Fetching inside your components is great for simple use cases, but it's prone to data loading waterfalls and makes code harder to work with because of the promise handling. SvelteKit solves this problem by providing a opinionated data loading story that is coupled to its router. Learn more about it in the docs.

## docs/svelte/04-styling/index.md

--- title: Styling ---

## docs/svelte/04-styling/01-scoped-styles.md

--- title: Scoped styles --- Svelte components can include a `<style>` element containing CSS that belongs to the component. This CSS is _scoped_ by default, meaning that styles will not apply to any elements on the page outside the component in question. This works by adding a class to affected elements, which is based on a hash of the component styles (e.g. `svelte-123xyz`). `svelte <style> p { /* this will only affect <p> elements in this component */ color: burlywood; } </style>` ## Specificity Each scoped selector receives a specificity increase of 0-1-0, as a result of the scoping class (e.g. `.svelte-123xyz`) being added to the selector. This means that (for example) a `p` selector defined in a component will take precedence over a `p` selector defined in a global stylesheet, even if the global stylesheet is loaded later. In some cases, the scoping class must be added to a selector multiple times, but after the first occurrence it is added with `:where(.svelte-xyz123)` in order to not increase specificity further. ## Scoped keyframes If a component defines `@keyframes`, the name is scoped to the component using the same hashing approach. Any `animation` rules in the component will be similarly adjusted: `svelte <style> .bouncy { animation: bounce 10s; } /* these keyframes are only accessible inside this component */ @keyframes bounce { /* ... */ } </style>`

## docs/svelte/04-styling/02-global-styles.md

--- title: Global styles --- ## :global(...) To apply styles to a single selector globally, use the `:global(...)` modifier: ``svelte <style> :global(body) { /* applies to <body> */ margin: 0; } div :global(strong) { /* applies to all <strong> elements, in any component, that are inside <div> elements belonging to this component */ color: goldenrod; } p:global(.big.red) { /* applies to all <p> elements belonging to this component with `class="big red"`, even if it is applied programmatically (for example by a library) */ } </style>`` If you want to make @keyframes that are accessible globally, you need to prepend your keyframe names with `-global-`. The `-global-` part will be removed when compiled, and the keyframe will then be referenced using just `my-animation-name` elsewhere in your code. `svelte <style> @keyframes -global-my-animation-name { /* code goes here */ } </style>` ## :global To apply styles to a group of selectors globally, create a `:global {...}` block: ``svelte <style> :global { /* applies to every <div> in your application */ div { ... } /* applies to every <p> in your application */ p { ... } } .a :global { /* applies to every `.b .c .d` element, in any component, that is inside an `.a` element in this component */ .b .c .d {...} } </style>``

## docs/svelte/04-styling/03-custom-properties.md

--- title: Custom properties --- You can pass CSS custom properties — both static and dynamic — to components: `svelte <Slider bind:value min={0} max={100} --track-color="black" --thumb-color="rgb({r} {g} {b})" />` The above code essentially desugars to this: `svelte <svelte-css-wrapper style="display: contents; --track-color: black; --thumb-color: rgb({r} {g} {b})"> <Slider bind:value min={0} max={100} /> </svelte-css-wrapper>` For an SVG element, it would use `<g>` instead: `svelte <g style="--track-color: black; --thumb-color: rgb({r} {g} {b})"> <Slider bind:value min={0} max={100} /> </g>` Inside the component, we can read these custom properties (and provide fallback values) using `var(...)`: `svelte <style> .track { background: var(--track-color, #aaa); } .thumb { background: var(--thumb-color, blue); } </style>` You don't _have_ to specify the values directly on the component; as long as the custom properties are defined on a parent element, the component can use them. It's common to define custom properties on the `:root` element in a global stylesheet so that they apply to your entire application.

## docs/svelte/04-styling/04-nested-style-elements.md

--- title: Nested <style> elements --- There can only be one top-level `<style>` tag per component. However, it is possible to have a `<style>` tag nested inside other elements or logic blocks. In that case, the `<style>` tag will be inserted as-is into the DOM; no scoping or processing will be done on the `<style>` tag. ``svelte <div> <style> /* this style tag will be inserted as-is */ div { /* this will apply to all `<div>` elements in the DOM */ color: red; } </style> </div>``

## docs/svelte/05-special-elements/01-svelte-boundary.md

--- title: <svelte:boundary> --- `svelte <svelte:boundary onerror={handler}>...</svelte:boundary>` > This feature was added in 5.3.0 Boundaries allow you to guard against errors in part of your app from breaking the app as a whole, and to recover from those errors. If an error occurs while rendering or updating the children of a `<svelte:boundary>`, or running any `$effect` functions contained therein, the contents will be removed. Errors occurring outside the rendering process (for example, in event handlers or after a `setTimeout` or async work) are _not_ caught by error boundaries. ## Properties For the boundary to do anything, one or both of `failed` and `onerror` must be provided. ### `failed` If a `failed` snippet is provided, it will be rendered with the error that was thrown, and a `reset` function that recreates the contents (demo): `svelte <svelte:boundary> <FlakyComponent /> {#snippet failed(error, reset)} <button onclick={reset}>oops! try again</button> {/snippet} </svelte:boundary>` > As with snippets passed to components, the `failed` snippet can be passed explicitly as a property... > > `svelte > <svelte:boundary {failed}>...</svelte:boundary> >` > > ...or implicitly by declaring it directly inside the boundary, as in the example above. ### `onerror` If an `onerror` function is provided, it will be called with the same two `error` and `reset` arguments. This is useful for tracking the error with an error reporting service... `svelte <svelte:boundary onerror={(e) => report(e)}> ... </svelte:boundary>` ...or using `error` and `reset` outside the boundary itself: `svelte <script> let error = $state(null); let reset = $state(() => {}); function onerror(e, r) { error = e; reset = r; } </script> <svelte:boundary {onerror}> <FlakyComponent /> </svelte:boundary> {#if error} <button onclick={() => { error = null; reset(); }}> oops! try again </button> {/if}` If an error occurs inside the `onerror` function (or if you rethrow the error), it will be handled by a parent boundary if such exists.

## docs/svelte/05-special-elements/02-svelte-window.md

--- title: <svelte:window> --- `svelte <svelte:window onevent={handler} />` `svelte <svelte:window bind:prop={value} />` The `<svelte:window>` element allows you to add event listeners to the `window` object without worrying about removing them when the component is destroyed, or checking for the existence of `window` when server-side rendering. This element may only appear at the top level of your component — it cannot be inside a block or element. ``svelte <script> function handleKeydown(event) { alert(`pressed the ${event.key} key`); } </script> <svelte:window onkeydown={handleKeydown} />`` You can also bind to the following properties: - `innerWidth` - `innerHeight` - `outerWidth` - `outerHeight` - `scrollX` - `scrollY` - `online` — an alias for `window.navigator.onLine` - `devicePixelRatio` All except `scrollX` and `scrollY` are readonly. `svelte <svelte:window bind:scrollY={y} />`

## docs/svelte/05-special-elements/03-svelte-document.md

--- title: <svelte:document> --- `svelte <svelte:document onevent={handler} />` `svelte <svelte:document bind:prop={value} />` Similarly to `<svelte:window>`, this element allows you to add listeners to events on `document`, such as `visibilitychange`, which don't fire on `window`. It also lets you use actions on `document`. As with `<svelte:window>`, this element may only appear the top level of your component and must never be inside a block or element. `svelte <svelte:document onvisibilitychange={handleVisibilityChange} use:someAction />` You can also bind to the following properties: - `activeElement` - `fullscreenElement` - `pointerLockElement` - `visibilityState` All are readonly.

## docs/svelte/05-special-elements/04-svelte-body.md

--- title: <svelte:body> --- `svelte <svelte:body onevent={handler} />` Similarly to `<svelte:window>`, this element allows you to add listeners to events on `document.body`, such as `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`, which don't fire on `window`. It also lets you use actions on the `<body>` element. As with `<svelte:window>` and `<svelte:document>`, this element may only appear the top level of your component and must never be inside a block or element. `svelte <svelte:body onmouseenter={handleMouseenter} onmouseleave={handleMouseleave} use:someAction />`

## docs/svelte/05-special-elements/05-svelte-head.md

--- title: <svelte:head> --- `svelte <svelte:head>...</svelte:head>` This element makes it possible to insert elements into `document.head`. During server-side rendering, `head` content is exposed separately to the main `body` content. As with `<svelte:window>`, `<svelte:document>` and `<svelte:body>`, this element may only appear at the top level of your component and must never be inside a block or element. `svelte <svelte:head> <title>Hello world!</title> <meta name="description" content="This is where the description goes for SEO" /> </svelte:head>`

## docs/svelte/05-special-elements/06-svelte-element.md

--- title: <svelte:element> --- `svelte <svelte:element this={expression} />` The `<svelte:element>` element lets you render an element that is unknown at author time, for example because it comes from a CMS. Any properties and event listeners present will be applied to the element. The only supported binding is `bind:this`, since Svelte's built-in bindings do not work with generic elements. If `this` has a nullish value, the element and its children will not be rendered. If `this` is the name of a void element (e.g., `br`) and `<svelte:element>` has child elements, a runtime error will be thrown in development mode: `svelte <script> let tag = $state('hr'); </script> <svelte:element this={tag}> This text cannot appear inside an hr element </svelte:element>` Svelte tries its best to infer the correct namespace from the element's surroundings, but it's not always possible. You can make it explicit with an `xmlns` attribute: `svelte <svelte:element this={tag} xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" />` `this` needs to be a valid DOM element tag, things like `#text` or `svelte:head` will not work.

## docs/svelte/06-runtime/index.md

--- title: Runtime ---

## docs/svelte/06-runtime/02-context.md

--- title: Context --- Context allows components to access values owned by parent components without passing them down as props (potentially through many layers of intermediate components, known as 'prop-drilling'). The parent component sets context with `setContext(key, value)`... `svelte <!file: Parent.svelte> <script> import { setContext } from 'svelte'; setContext('my-context', 'hello from Parent.svelte'); </script>` ...and the child retrieves it with `getContext`: `svelte <!file: Child.svelte> <script> import { getContext } from 'svelte'; const message = getContext('my-context'); </script> <h1>{message}, inside Child.svelte</h1>` This is particularly useful when `Parent.svelte` is not directly aware of `Child.svelte`, but instead renders it as part of a `children` snippet (demo): `svelte <Parent> <Child /> </Parent>` The key (`'my-context'`, in the example above) and the context itself can be any JavaScript value. In addition to `setContext` and `getContext`, Svelte exposes `hasContext` and `getAllContexts` functions. ## Using context with state You can store reactive state in context (demo)... `svelte <script> import { setContext } from 'svelte'; import Child from './Child.svelte'; let counter = $state({ count: 0 }); setContext('counter', counter); </script> <button onclick={() => counter.count += 1}> increment </button> <Child /> <Child /> <Child />` ...though note that if you _reassign_ `counter` instead of updating it, you will 'break the link' — in other words instead of this... `svelte <button onclick={() => counter = { count: 0 }}> reset </button>` ...you must do this: `svelte <button onclick={() =>counter.count = 0}> reset </button>` Svelte will warn you if you get it wrong. ## Type-safe context A useful pattern is to wrap the calls to `setContext` and `getContext` inside helper functions that let you preserve type safety: `js /// file: context.js // @filename: ambient.d.ts interface User {} // @filename: index.js //cut import { getContext, setContext } from 'svelte'; let key = {}; /** @param {User} user */ export function setUserContext(user) { setContext(key, user); } export function getUserContext() { return /** @type {User} */ (getContext(key)); }` ## Replacing global state When you have state shared by many different components, you might be tempted to put it in its own module and just import it wherever it's needed: `js /// file: state.svelte.js export const myGlobalState = $state({ user: { // ... } // ... });` In many cases this is perfectly fine, but there is a risk: if you mutate the state during server-side rendering (which is discouraged, but entirely possible!)... `svelte <!file: App.svelte-> <script> import { myGlobalState } from 'svelte'; let { data } = $props(); if (data.user) { myGlobalState.user = data.user; } </script>` ...then the data may be accessible by the _next_ user. Context solves this problem because it is not shared between requests.

## docs/svelte/06-runtime/03-lifecycle-hooks.md

--- title: Lifecycle hooks --- In Svelte 5, the component lifecycle consists of only two parts: Its creation and its destruction. Everything in-between — when certain state is updated — is not related to the component as a whole; only the parts that need to react to the state change are notified. This is because under the hood the smallest unit of change is actually not a component, it's the (render) effects that the component sets up upon component initialization. Consequently, there's no such thing as a "before update"/"after update" hook. ## `onMount` The `onMount` function schedules a callback to run as soon as the component has been mounted to the DOM. It must be called during the component's initialisation (but doesn't need to live _inside_ the component; it can be called from an external module). `onMount` does not run inside a component that is rendered on the server. `svelte <script> import { onMount } from 'svelte'; onMount(() => { console.log('the component has mounted'); }); </script>` If a function is returned from `onMount`, it will be called when the component is unmounted. `svelte <script> import { onMount } from 'svelte'; onMount(() => { const interval = setInterval(() => { console.log('beep'); }, 1000); return () => clearInterval(interval); }); </script>` ## `onDestroy` Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is unmounted. Out of `onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate` and `onDestroy`, this is the only one that runs inside a server-side component. `svelte <script> import { onDestroy } from 'svelte'; onDestroy(() => { console.log('the component is being destroyed'); }); </script>` ## `tick` While there's no "after update" hook, you can use `tick` to ensure that the UI is updated before continuing. `tick` returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied, or in the next microtask if there are none. `svelte <script> import { tick } from 'svelte'; $effect.pre(() => { console.log('the component is about to update'); tick().then(() => { console.log('the component just updated'); }); }); </script>` ## Deprecated: `beforeUpdate` / `afterUpdate` Svelte 4 contained hooks that ran before and after the component as a whole was updated. For backwards compatibility, these hooks were shimmed in Svelte 5 but not available inside components that use runes. `svelte <script> import { beforeUpdate, afterUpdate } from 'svelte'; beforeUpdate(() => { console.log('the component is about to update'); }); afterUpdate(() => { console.log('the component just updated'); }); </script>` Instead of `beforeUpdate` use `$effect.pre` and instead of `afterUpdate` use `$effect` instead - these runes offer more granular control and only react to the changes you're actually interested in. ### Chat window example To implement a chat window that autoscrolls to the bottom when new messages appear (but only if you were _already_ scrolled to the bottom), we need to measure the DOM before we update it. In Svelte 4, we do this with `beforeUpdate`, but this is a flawed approach — it fires before _every_ update, whether it's relevant or not. In the example below, we need to introduce checks like `updatingMessages` to make sure we don't mess with the scroll position when someone toggles dark mode. With runes, we can use `$effect.pre`, which behaves the same as `$effect` but runs before the DOM is updated. As long as we explicitly reference `messages` inside the effect body, it will run whenever `messages` changes, but _not_ when `theme` changes. `beforeUpdate`, and its equally troublesome counterpart `afterUpdate`, are therefore deprecated in Svelte 5. - Before - After `svelte <script> import {beforeUpdate, afterUpdate,tick } from 'svelte'; let updatingMessages = false; let theme =$state('dark'); let messages =$state([]); let viewport; beforeUpdate(() => { $effect.pre(() => { if (!updatingMessages) return; messages; const autoscroll = viewport && viewport.offsetHeight + viewport.scrollTop > viewport.scrollHeight - 50; if (autoscroll) { tick().then(() => { viewport.scrollTo(0, viewport.scrollHeight); }); } updatingMessages = false; }); function handleKeydown(event) { if (event.key === 'Enter') { const text = event.target.value; if (!text) return; updatingMessages = true; messages = [...messages, text]; event.target.value = ''; } } function toggle() { theme = theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'; } </script> <div class:dark={theme === 'dark'}> <div bind:this={viewport}> {#each messages as message} <p>{message}</p> {/each} </div> <inputonkeydown={handleKeydown} /> <buttononclick={toggle}> Toggle dark mode </button> </div>`

## docs/svelte/06-runtime/04-imperative-component-api.md

--- title: Imperative component API --- Every Svelte application starts by imperatively creating a root component. On the client this component is mounted to a specific element. On the server, you want to get back a string of HTML instead which you can render. The following functions help you achieve those tasks. ## `mount` Instantiates a component and mounts it to the given target: `js // @errors: 2322 import { mount } from 'svelte'; import App from './App.svelte'; const app = mount(App, { target: document.querySelector('#app'), props: { some: 'property' } });` You can mount multiple components per page, and you can also mount from within your application, for example when creating a tooltip component and attaching it to the hovered element. Note that unlike calling `new App(...)` in Svelte 4, things like effects (including `onMount` callbacks, and action functions) will not run during `mount`. If you need to force pending effects to run (in the context of a test, for example) you can do so with `flushSync()`. ## `unmount` Unmounts a component that was previously created with `mount` or `hydrate`. If `options.outro` is `true`, transitions will play before the component is removed from the DOM: `js import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte'; import App from './App.svelte'; const app = mount(App, { target: document.body }); // later unmount(app, { outro: true });` Returns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise. ## `render` Only available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option. Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app: `js // @errors: 2724 2305 2307 import { render } from 'svelte/server'; import App from './App.svelte'; const result = render(App, { props: { some: 'property' } }); result.body; // HTML for somewhere in this <body> tag result.head; // HTML for somewhere in this <head> tag` ## `hydrate` Like `mount`, but will reuse up any HTML rendered by Svelte's SSR output (from the `render` function) inside the target and make it interactive: `js // @errors: 2322 import { hydrate } from 'svelte'; import App from './App.svelte'; const app = hydrate(App, { target: document.querySelector('#app'), props: { some: 'property' } });` As with `mount`, effects will not run during `hydrate` — use `flushSync()` immediately afterwards if you need them to.
