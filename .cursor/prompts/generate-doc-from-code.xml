</Core_Task_Instructions>

<Step_By_Step_Execution_Plan>
	**STEP 0: Confirm Understanding (RaR)**
	- Briefly restate the core task assigned to you.
	- Identify the input source code you will be documenting.

	**STEP 1: Code Analysis (Tab-CoT)**
	- Analyze the provided code according to the Original Prompt's "Step 1: Code Analysis" section (purpose, language, complexity, key components/relationships, data flow).
	- CRITICALLY identify potential **CONFUSING PARTS** or patterns and specific **VISUALIZATION OPPORTUNITIES**.
	- Present your analysis concisely in a MARKDOWN table format with columns: `Aspect`, `Details`.

	```markdown
	| Aspect                    | Details                                      |
	| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
	| Main Purpose              | ...                                          |
	| Language/Frameworks       | ...                                          |
	| Complexity Level          | ...                                          |
	| Key Component/Function X  | Role: ..., Relationships: ...                |
	| Data Flow                 | ...                                          |
	| **Confusing Part Candidate** | (e.g., Naming of variable Y, complex logic in function Z) |
	| **Visualization Idea**      | (e.g., Flowchart for function Z, Sequence diagram for interaction A->B) |
	| ...                       | ...                                          |
	```

	**STEP 2: Documentation Plan (Tab-CoT)**
	- Based on your analysis in Step 1, create a detailed plan for the documentation document.
	- Cover the elements mentioned in the Original Prompt's "Step 2: Documentation Planning".
	- Include sections for Overview, Architecture, Core Functionality, API (if applicable), Usage Examples, and planned explanations for confusing parts.
	- Explicitly plan which **VISUALIZATIONS** (including specific **MERMAID** diagram types) you will use and where.
	- Plan how you will balance explanations for beginners and experts.
	- Include ideas for **CREATIVE ADDITIONS** that enhance clarity beyond the basics.
	- Present your plan in a MARKDOWN table format with columns: `Document Section`, `Content Summary`, `Key Code Example(s)`, `Planned Visualization (Type + Description)`, `Confusing Part Addressed?`, `Explanation Strategy`, `Creative Addition?`.

	```markdown
	| Document Section          | Content Summary | Key Code Example(s) | Planned Visualization (Type + Description) | Confusing Part Addressed? | Explanation Strategy | Creative Addition? |
	| :------------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------- | :----------------- |
	| 개요 (Overview)          | ...             | ...                 | None                                       | No                        | ...                    | No                 |
	| 아키텍처 (Architecture)  | ...             | ...                 | Component Diagram: High-level structure    | Maybe (overall structure) | ...                    | Yes (Analogy)      |
	| 핵심 기능: 함수 Z (Core) | ...             | `funcZ()` example   | Mermaid Flowchart: Logic flow              | Yes (complex logic)       | Step-by-step walkthru  | No                 |
	| 혼동하기 쉬운 부분 (Confusing) | Why variable Y is confusing | Snippet of Y usage | None                                       | Yes (naming)              | Analogy, clarification | No                 |
	| ...                       | ...             | ...                 | ...                                        | ...                       | ...                    | ...                |
	```

	**STEP 3: Generate Markdown Documentation**
	- Following your plan from Step 2, generate the **FINAL MARKDOWN DOCUMENT**.
	- **LANGUAGE AND TONE:** Write **ENTIRELY** in **INFORMAL KOREAN** (`반말체` or noun endings). Bad example: "이 함수는 데이터를 검증합니다." Good example: "이 함수는 데이터를 검증해." or use noun endings if more appropriate. Everything for easier and faster understanding.
	- **STRUCTURE AND FORMATTING:** Use appropriate Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.), lists, code blocks, tables, etc., for readability and easy skimming.
	- **CONTENT:** Include the planned sections (Overview, Architecture, Core Functionality, API, Examples, Confusing Parts explanations, Creative Additions). DO NOT just copy the provided code; explain it. Use code snippets judiciously for examples.
	- **VISUALIZATIONS:**
			- Integrate **MERMAID DIAGRAMS** where planned. Provide the ` ```mermaid ... ``` ` code block directly in the Markdown. Use appropriate types: `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`, `componentDiagram`.
			- **CRITICAL: MERMAID SYNTAX PRECAUTIONS (MUST FOLLOW):**
					- To prevent parsing errors, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE RULES:
					- **ALWAYS** enclose node text containing special characters (like **parentheses `()`**, **periods `.`**, **question marks `?`**, hash `#`, colon `:`, etc.) in **DOUBLE QUOTES (`"`)**.
								- *Error Example:* `B{Check function() call?}` -> Causes Error!
								- *Fix:* `B{"Check function() call?"}`
								- *Error Example:* `C[Next step(process)]` -> Causes Error!
								- *Fix:* `C["Next step(process)"]`
					- Use **DOUBLE QUOTES (`"`)** around subgraph titles containing spaces or special characters.
					- Enclose complex text in sequence diagram messages in **QUOTES**.
					- Keep node IDs simple (alphanumeric, e.g., `node1`, `processA`) and use special characters ONLY in the *displayed text* (inside quotes).
					- When using HTML tags like `<br/>`, ensure the entire node text is **QUOTED**.
					- **AVOID** parentheses `()` and special characters in node text if possible. Use **SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS**.
					- **Simplify** technical terms if needed for node text (e.g., `page.evaluate()` -> `"evaluate function"`).
			- Include other visuals as planned (e.g., Markdown tables to represent Types, diagrams/commentary near code blocks).
	- **CONFUSING PARTS:** Explicitly address the confusing parts identified in your plan. Explain *why* they might be confusing and provide clear clarifications, potentially using analogies or step-by-step breakdowns. Address potential misunderstandings, non-standard patterns, performance issues, side effects, error possibilities, and common mistakes as relevant.

	**STEP 4: Self-Review**
	- Critically review the Markdown document you generated in Step 3.
	- Answer the following questions based on your generated document (from the Original Prompt):
			- Have all important aspects of the code been explained?
			- Is the document logically structured?
			- **Do the diagrams and visual materials actually help understand the code?**
			- **Are complex logic or structures visually clearly expressed?**
			- **Do the diagrams effectively emphasize the most important aspects of the code?**
			- **Are easily confused parts explained in sufficient detail?**
			- **Will readers be able to properly understand and utilize the code after reading this document?**
			- **Are there clear explanations for difficult concepts or non-intuitive code parts?**
			- Does it provide useful information for both beginners and experts?
			- Do the examples well demonstrate actual use cases and help understanding?
	- Provide a brief **summary** of your review findings.

</Step_By_Step_Execution_Plan>

<Example_Section_Demonstration>
	<Instruction>Here is a small example demonstrating the desired style for documenting a single function:</Instruction>
	<Example>
	```markdown
	### `calculateTotal(items)` 함수

	이 함수는 장바구니 아이템 목록을 받아서 총 가격을 계산해주는 함수야.

	#### 작동 방식

	각 아이템의 가격과 수량을 곱한 값을 모두 더해서 최종 합계를 반환해.

	```mermaid
	flowchart TD
			A[시작] --> B{아이템 목록 루프};
			B -- 각 아이템 --> C{"가격 * 수량 계산"};
			C --> D[합계에 더하기];
			D --> B;
			B -- 루프 종료 --> E[최종 합계 반환];
			E --> F[종료];
	```

	#### **주의할 점!**

	-   `items` 배열의 각 요소에는 `price`와 `quantity` 속성이 꼭 있어야 해. 없으면 에러가 날 수 있어! (현재 에러 처리 로직은 없어.)
	-   가격이 음수거나 수량이 이상한 값일 경우에 대한 검증은 따로 없어. 입력값을 잘 확인해야 해.
	```
	</Example>
