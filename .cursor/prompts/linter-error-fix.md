# **Your Task: Linter Error Resolution**

The inclusion of these instructions signifies that your primary mission is to resolve the Linter errors within the code files accompanying this prompt. The specific code files requiring modification and the corresponding Linter error reports is supposed to be included as attachments.

## **Instructions (Follow these steps sequentially):**

1. **Classify Linter Errors:**
   First, analyze and categorize _all_ reported Linter errors into one of the following three groups:

   1. **False Positives:** Errors reported by the linter that do not represent actual problems or violations of intended coding standards in the context of this project.
   2. **Requires Major Refactoring / Too Large:** Errors that necessitate significant code restructuring, have complex dependencies, or represent a task too large/involved to be bundled with routine fixes. These should be flagged for separate, potentially manual, review or a dedicated refactoring effort.
   3. **Actionable Errors:** Genuine errors that can and should be resolved through direct code modification to improve code quality, adhere to standards, or fix potential bugs.

2. **Develop Resolution Plans (for Actionable Errors):**
   For _each_ Linter error classified as an **Actionable Error** (category 3), you must create a detailed resolution plan. Focus on planning _before_ implementing any code changes.

   - **Objective:** Outline precisely how you will fix the error and improve the relevant code section.
   - **Detail Level:** Your plan must be **highly detailed, specific, and unambiguous**. Prioritize comprehensive planning at this stage.

   **Required Content for Each Actionable Error's Resolution Plan:**

   1. **Error Location:** Specify the exact file(s) and line number(s) where the error occurs.
   2. **Cause Analysis:** Clearly explain the root cause of the Linter error according to the linting rule violated.
   3. **Potential Issues / Consideration / Confusing Partss:** Identify any areas requiring caution during the fix. This includes potential side effects, dependencies on other code sections, or aspects that might be easily misunderstood or lead to incorrect fixes.
   4. **Proposed Solution & Improvement:** Describe the step-by-step changes you will make to the code to resolve the error. Include any related code improvements that should be made concurrently for better quality or clarity.

   Please Include _All_ 4 items per Actionable Error.
   Do NOT write codes in this stage.
